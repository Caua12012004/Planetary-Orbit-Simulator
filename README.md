# Planetary-Orbit-Simulator


If you are a student, this project can help you:
       #To obtain skills in pygame and pygame_gui;
       #To understand how to get user input in pygame;
       #How to handle multiple pages in pygame; 
       #How to handle user input and preview errors in pygame; and
       #Physics and physics simulations with pygame. 

If you are a techer: 
       #This project requires very basic python skills for you to run it on your computer; and 
       #You can design your own solar system for your class easily.
